Files Format:

#Steps File#
This file will be saved in the following format of file name: pacman_*.steps 
while the * represent the board which the steps file is related to (for example "pacman_A.steps").
Each line of the steps file will contain the point in time (one iteration of the game).
after the point in time, will be presented pairs (number that represent the the creature 
and number that represent the direction), each number either the creature number or the 
direction number is mapped by a enum located in the PacmanGame.h file and the enum.h file.
In case of fruit, there are 3 possible changes:direction, appearence (after a while of 
diapearence) and disappearence.
therefor we defined that the fruit will be seperated to 3 options for each type of change.
in case of of direction change the fruit will get a number that represent the new direction,
in case of disappearence there is no additional pararmeter, and in case of appearence
we will save the new position which was randomly chosen, the char which was radomly chosen from 5-9 and than the direction.


The releant enum:
enum STEPS_CHANGES {PACMAN, GHOST0, GHOST1, GHOST2, GHOST3, FRUIT, FRUIT_APPEAR, FRUIT_DISAPPEAR, STEPS_SIZE};

example of a line in the  steps file:
38 3 0 4 0 
the line represent that in point in time 38 the ghost[2] changed direction left and  the ghost[3] changed direction left.

#Result File#
This file will be saved in the following format of file name: pacman_*.result 
while the * represent the board which the result file is related to (for example "pacman_A.result").
Each line of the result file contains the point in time , 0 if the pacman died in that point of the game
and 1 if the player finished the board.

the numbers are mapped in a enum located in the PacmanGame.h

related enum:
enum RESULT_CHANGES {PACMAN_DIED, FINISHED_SCREEN, RESULT_SIZE};


example of a line in the  result file:
192 0 
here in point in time 192 the pacman died.
